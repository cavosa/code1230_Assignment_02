			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>Data journalism is a journalism specialty reflecting the increased role that numerical data is used in the production and distribution of information in the digital era. It reflects the increased interaction between content producers (journalist) and several other fields such as design, computer science and statistics</p>
			<p>The data that will be presented in this data journal shows the Count of persons aged 15 years and over who in the two weeks prior to census night, spent time caring for a child/children (under 15 years) without pay.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "one-half">
			<h3>Statistical Areas Level 1</h3>
			<p>Mesh blocks are built wholly to represent geographical areas or Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1). Census data has been designed and released in the smallest unit by SA1s, which have a population of between 200 and 800 people with an average population size of 400 people. The census data itself is collected every 5 years.</p>

			<h1>Story Behind the Data</h1>
			<p>The data shown here was collected from participatory individuals. However, a much broader demographic has been shunned from coverage. Taking care of children, in general, is working. It might be unpaid, but it is still work and, if parents didn’t do it, they would have to pay someone else to do it. Hence, unpaid childcare is Australia’s largest industry.</p>
			<p>After pre-analysis, the data presented in this journal aims to show updated statistics of involvement in unpaid child care by gender, across the more popular age groups among child care participants. Moreover, it identifies their apparent roles in society, like in this case, those that are in the early retirement age participate the most in upaid child care. This may point to the fact that young parents often leave their children with the grandparents to take care of. </p>
