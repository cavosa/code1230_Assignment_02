          <li> Define a mesh block, SA1. What years does the census take place.
          <li> What is data journalism? Find and link to a good piece of data journalism.
          <li> You will be given a data set. Identify a possible user of the data, and a possible use.
          <li> Identify a compelling story within your data.
          <li> Tell that story in words, answering the Kipling questions: who, what, how, why?
          <li> Visualize that story on a map using colour, using legends. What is the latte line? How does your story relate to the latte line?
          <li> Using the height attribute, overlay complementary data that enriches the story. Explain why you chose that data.
          <li> Arrange your maps and words in a coherent fashion. Think of it as a piece of data journalism that gives enough context that someone seeing the site for the first time would be able to understand everything.
