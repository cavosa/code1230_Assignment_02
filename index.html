		<h1>Story Behind the Data</h1>
		<p>The data shown here was collected from participatory individuals. However, a much broader demographic has been shunned from coverage. Taking care of children, in general, is working. It might be unpaid, but it is still work and, if parents didn’t do it, they would have to pay someone else to do it. Hence, unpaid childcare is Australia’s largest industry.</p>
		<p>After pre-analysis, the data presented in this journal aims to identify updated statistics of involvement in unpaid child care by gender, across the more popular age groups between the child care participants. </p>
		<p>Knowing these sets of information allows state governments to allocate appropriate funding for special child care work so that the value of unpaid work can be quantified.</p>
